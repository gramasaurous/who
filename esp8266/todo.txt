esp8266 support

- simplify, remove as much external deps as possible
	- requests
	- logging
	- json is included in esp8266 micropython so ok
- build basic HTTP GET, PUT as drop in replacement for requests
	- otherwise try to get requests on esp8266 micropython
	- (it is available on the micropython-lib repo)
		https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib
	- UPDATE: was able to get urequests working - as expected,
		exceptions are handled differently so some things need
		to be modified
- remove logging requests - replace with simple debug prints
