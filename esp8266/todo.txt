esp8266 support

- simplify, remove as much external deps as possible
	- requests
	- logging
	- json is included in esp8266 micropython so ok
- build basic HTTP GET, PUT as drop in replacement for requests
	- otherwise try to get requests on esp8266 micropython
	- (it is available on the micropython-lib repo)
		https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib
	- UPDATE: was able to get urequests working - as expected,
		exceptions are handled differently so some things need
		to be modified
- remove logging requests - replace with simple debug prints 
- get gpio switch working with interrupt callbacks

update:
- interrupt callback code has limitations and must be simple
- one such limitation is no memory allocation
- i have shifted all memory allocation inside Who.Light.change_status
	to Light.__init__
- unfortunately, requests needs to allocate memory so we have options:
	- don't use interrupts
	- rewrite requests to accept pre-allocated memory
	- don't use requests, write a simple HTTP interface
